### **🚀 Recommended Strategy: Contribution Approach**

#### **1. Position as Pattern Contributor**
- **Current State**: forge-mcp-gateway has more advanced CI/CD than forge-patterns
- **Strategy**: Contribute forge-mcp-gateway workflows as enhanced patterns
- **Benefit**: Elevates forge-patterns repository with advanced capabilities

#### **2. Create Enhanced Base Templates**
- **Action**: Extract forge-mcp-gateway advanced features into reusable templates
- **Templates to Create**:
  - `base-ci-enhanced.yml`: Multi-language CI with advanced features
  - `base-security-comprehensive.yml`: Multi-language security scanning
  - `base-coverage-advanced.yml`: Coverage reporting with quality gates
  - `base-integration-testing.yml`: Service integration testing

#### **3. Maintain Current Superiority**
- **Decision**: Keep current forge-mcp-gateway workflows as-is
- **Reason**: Downgrading would reduce capabilities and break existing functionality
