# .shellcheckrc
#
# Strict shellcheck configuration for all Forge shell scripts.
# Philosophy: mirrors TypeScript strictTypeChecked and Python ruff's broad rule selection.
#
# Usage:
#   shellcheck --rcfile=.shellcheckrc script.sh

# All Forge scripts target bash explicitly.
shell=bash

# Enable all optional checks (not active by default):
#   SC2250 — prefer "${var}" over "$var" in most contexts
#   SC2248 — prefer double-quoting even simple variable expansions
#   SC2312 — consider invoking command separately to avoid masking return value
enable=all

# Disabled rules — structural false positives only:
#   SC1091 — "not following source": sourced files (log.sh, errors.sh, lib/*.sh) are not
#             on PATH at lint time; shellcheck cannot follow them.
#   SC2034 — "variable appears unused": false positive in sourced helper files
#             where variables are exported for use by the sourcing script.
disable=SC1091,SC2034
