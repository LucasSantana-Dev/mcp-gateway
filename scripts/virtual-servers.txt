# Virtual servers: Name|gateway1,gateway2,... (one per line). Used to stay under Cursor's ~60-tool limit per connection.
# Gateways must match names in gateways.txt exactly (e.g. sequential-thinking, filesystem, tavily). Max 60 tools per server.
# If two lines would attach the same tool set, only the first server is created/updated; the other is skipped to avoid duplicates.
# After editing, run: make register
# Connect Cursor to one server URL (e.g. .../servers/<UUID>/mcp) from the script output.

# cursor-default: core dev + search + browser (under 60 tools)
